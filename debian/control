Description: kernel time variables configuration utility
 This package provides a utility to manipulate the kernel time
 variables.  For a machine connected to the Internet, or equipped with
 a precision oscillator or radio clock, the best way to keep the
 system clock accurate is using NTP (Network Time Protocol).  However,
 for a standalone or intermittently connected machine, you may use
 adjtimex instead to at least correct for systematic drift.  It can
 optionally adjust the system clock using the CMOS clock as a
 reference, and can log times for long-term estimation of drift rates.
