"The adjtimexconfig script will use adjtimex to find values for the kernel "
"variables \"tick\" and \"frequency\" that will make the system clock "
"approximately agree with the hardware clock (also known as the CMOS clock).  "
"It then saves these values in the configuration file /etc/default/adjtimex "
"so the settings will be restored on every boot, when /etc/init.d/adjtimex "
"runs."

"The script takes 70 seconds to run, so running it for every upgrade may be a "
"waste of time. Alternatively, you can run adjtimexconfig manually when "
"needed, or determine the kernel variables by using other methods and set "
"them manually in /etc/default/adjtimex."
