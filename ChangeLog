2009-03-22  James R. Van Zandt  <jrvz@comcast.net>

	* Makefile.in (VERSION): version 1.27

	* adjtimex.c (review): HELP is an enum instead of a #define.

	* adjtimex.c: Add some training calls to gettimeofday, so
	following calls will be more accurate (thanks to Alain Guibert
	<alguibert+bts@free.fr>).

2009-03-14  James R. Van Zandt  <jrvz@comcast.net>

	* adjtimex.c (review): Compute CMOS frequency error in PPM of CMOS
	time (thanks to Alain Guibert <alguibert+bts@free.fr>).
	(review): Compute sys_time or the relative error between CMOS and
	sys_time in PPM of sys_time.

2009-03-14  Alain Guibert <alguibert@free.fr>

	* adjtimex.c (compare, log_times): The first call to
	gettimeofday() in a process takes longer than usual, and the
	timestamp taken is a little bit late (up to 200 microseconds).
	Let's consume this bad call, so that the important timestamps
	are all coherant at the top of accuracy.

	* (log_times): We don't need the kernel's internal timezone.
	Let's stop requesting it.

2009-03-11  James R. Van Zandt  <jrvz@comcast.net>

	* adjtimex.8: Document --force-adjust option.

	* adjtimex.c (longopt): --force-adjust overrides +-500 ppm sanity
	check.  verbose is now a counter, -V increases verbosity.  Require
	more than one option for several printouts.  Print
	invalid option characters.  If stating local time, explicitly say
	with or without summertime adjustment.

2009-03-10  James R. Van Zandt  <jrvz@comcast.net>

	* adjtimex.c (cmos_read_time): use select() instead of a timer to
	avoid blocking even if /dev/rtc never becomes readable.  (That
	code was misplaced at some point in the last year.)  If using
	update interrupt, sanity check the delay.  Sometimes the status
	includes an update complete flag, but it actually didn't wait.

2008-08-17  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.comcast.net>

	* Makefile.in (VERSION): Write ISO8601 format data to .lsm file.
	Include commands to build Makefile (i.e. ./configure).  version
	1.26

	* adjtimex.c (cmos_read_time): Fix a possible hang with the
	Intersil ISL1208, one of those new non-PC-compatible RTCs.
	Cleanly exits with an error message, instead of either hang or
	returning garbage. (Thanks to Alain Guibert).

	* adjtimex.lsm.in: Revise description, update file size.

2008-08-07  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.comcast.net>

	* Makefile.in (VERSION): version 1.25

	* adjtimex.8: document new --nointerrupt option

2008-08-07  James R. Van Zandt  <jrvz@comcast.net>

	* adjtimex.8: Kernels through 2.6 are still using the same
	adjtimex status values.  Mention new /dev file names.

	* adjtimex.c (cmos_init): try alternate ia64 and devfs device
	names (courtesy of hwclock sources).

	* adjtimex.c (cmos_read_time): Set an alarm to avoid blocking even
	if /dev/rtc never becomes readable, then fall back to
	busywait_second_change(). New --nointerrupt option to force
	busywait without waiting for the interrupt timeout (thanks to
	Alain Guibert).

2008-04-04  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.comcast.net>

	* Makefile (VERSION): version 1.24

	* adjtimex.c: Reorganize cmos_read_time() to properly integrate
	the fallback case for when /dev/rtc has no interrupts. Make this
	fallback actually work. fixes partially(?) Debian bug #460065 as
	by proposed solution #1 (Thanks to Alain Guibert
	<alguibert@free.fr>) (closes:Bug#471203)

	(cmos_read_time): Fix Y2K bug: read century from byte 50, instead
	of assuming we're in the range 1969-2068.

	(busywait_second_change) When /dev/rtc interrupt is
	not available, fallbacks to loops around ioctl(RTC_RD_TIME) until
	the RTC second changes. Patch applies to adjtimex 1.23 above first
	no-interrupt-fallback.patch fixes partially(?) Debian bug #460065
	as by proposed solution #3 (Thanks to: Alain Guibert
	<alguibert@free.fr>)

	(cmos_read_time) If /dev/rtc does not exist then automatically
	fallback to /dev/rtc0, so it works even without symlink. (Thanks
	to: Alain Guibert <alguibert@free.fr>)
	
2008-04-03  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.comcast.net>

	* adjtimex.c (main): fix typo in options handling (thanks to
	Miroslav Lichvar <mlichvar@redhat.com>)

2008-02-07  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.comcast.net>

	* adjtimex.c (log_times): Convert some fprintf writes to perror,
	add "adjtimex: " to several perror messages.

2008-02-01  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.comcast.net>

	* adjtimex.c: (cmos_read_time): use select() to avoid blocking even
	if /dev/rtc never becomes readable.

2007-10-06  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.comcast.net>

	* Makefile.in (VERSION): version 1.23

	* adjtimex.c (cmos_read_time): rename dummy to interrupt_info now
	that this read() value is actually used. (thanks to Alain Guibert
	<alguibert@free.fr>)

	* README: Rewrite USAGE paragraph. Remove point about creating
	zero adjfile. Document new behaviour without adjfile. Remove
	reference to the long outdated clock(8). Update URL for
	hwclock(8). (Thanks to Alain Guibert <alguibert@free.fr>)

	* adjtimex.c (cmos_read_time): The day-of-week value in the RTC
	free cycles from 1 to 7. This number is not synced with other RTC
	date values, but is only simply incremented at midnight. The day
	meant is in the eye of the reader, which nearly always just
	ignores the value. Most common assumption is that 1 means
	Sunday. (Thanks to Alain Guibert <alguibert@free.fr>)

	* adjtimex.c (compare): In case of absence of /etc/adjtime, do not
	fail, and do not force users to manually create it with 0.0
	content. Instead, proceed assuming zero values (meaning RTC does
	not drift). Also replace redundant code by a call to
	get_cmos_adjustment().  (Thanks to Alain Guibert
	<alguibert@free.fr>


2007-10-05  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.comcast.net>

	* adjtimex.c (busy_wait): timestamp more closely the RTC clock
	beat (thanks to Alain Guibert <alguibert at free.fr>, see Debian
	bug#443814).
	(usage): --directisa switch forces adjtimex to poll the
	update-in-process (UIP) flag of the CMOS clock (thanks to Alain
	Guibert <alguibert at free.fr>, see Debian bug#443773).

2007-09-23  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.comcast.net>

	* adjtimex.c (log_times): fix these bugs in ntpdate output
	interpretation (per Debian bug#438718):
        adjtimex has a bug in evaluating the output of ntpdate, because
        1. it assumes ntpdate outputs "adjust time server", but ntpdate
	may output "step time server" also
        2. it doesnt stop at last line but as soon as it has found "filter
	  offset:" lines, and because of this it will not find the "offset
	  ..." information in the last line.

2006-10-07  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.comcast.net>

	* adjtimex.c: don't declare adjtimex syscall (should already be
	getting the declaration from sys/timex.h)

2006-05-27  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.comcast.net>

	* adjtimex.c (log_times): Permit ntpdate to contact any number of
	time servers.
	(log_times): add -q to ntpdate command line
	(puthackent): with --verbose, display log entry and path to log
	file.
	(valid_system_rate, valid_cmos_rate): in messages, ask about
	/sbin/hwclock rather than the old /sbin/clock.
	(probe_time): If call to adjtimex fails, quit with error message.
	(Need root priv.)  Thus, "adjtimex -r" and "adjtimex -c" fail
	rather than succeeding with bogus results.

2006-05-26  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.comcast.net>

	* adjtimex.c (log_times): use stat to look for ntpdate in
	/usr/bin, /bin, /usr/sbin and /sbin. Close pipe with pclose
	instead of fclose.

	* adjtimex.8: express PLL time constant in terms of a power of two
	rather than the more obscure 1<<val.

2006-05-25  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.comcast.net>

	* adjtimex.c (log_times): Eliminate compare_cmos_sys(), call
	cmos_read_time() instead.

2006-05-24  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.comcast.net>

	* adjtimex.c (review): For both CMOS and system clocks, write
	suggested and current adjustments on a separate line from the
	estimated error in ppm.
	(cmos_read_time): Move the sanity check code (to adjust CMOS time
	by multiples of one hour) and code to read sytem time into this
	function.

2006-05-23  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.comcast.net>

	* adjtimex.c (compare_cmos_sys): delete code to find UTC time via
	switching TZ (was controlled by ZONESWITCH, which was not #defined).

	* adjtimex.8: -h specifies the host, so it can't also ask for the
	help printout.  -V or --verbose increases verbosity.  Shifting
	CMOS time by up to 13 hours.

2006-05-23  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* adjtimex.c (cmos_read_time): set tm_isdst to -1 to signal that
	summer time information is not available (/dev/rtc doesn't set it)

2006-05-22  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* adjtimex.c (cmos_read_time): adjust month, day of week, and year
	only if reading from /dev/port.

	* Makefile (VERSION): version 1.21

	* adjtimex.c (compare): Adjust CMOS times by + or - 60 min, if
	that brings them closer to the system time.  If they still differ
	by more than 6 min, then print a warning and suppress logging.
	(Thanks to Alain Guibert <alguibert at free.fr> for noting that
	summer time start/end can impact the log.)

2006-05-21  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* ChangeLog: Fix spelling of name Alain Guibert (sorry :-)

	* adjtimex.c (cmos_read_time): use /dev/rtc interface if possible
	(thanks to  Richard Henderson <rth at twiddle.net>).

2005-09-05  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* README: fix email address

2004-09-19  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* Makefile.in (VERSION): version 1.20

	* adjtimex.c (compare): in "compare" or "adjust", return
	immediately after printing last result (instead of sleeping an
	extra $interval seconds) (Thanks to Alain Guibert <alguibert at
	free.fr>)

2004-09-11  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* Makefile.in (VERSION): version 1.19

	* adjtimex.c (compare): Account for the current frequency value
	when calculating the recommended frequency value.  Simplify
	calculation of recommended tick.
	(compare): print estimated system clock error in ppm instead of
	obscure "second diff".

	* adjtimex.8: use 2^16 instead of the more obscure 1<<16.

	* adjtimex.c: revert to poll-wait instead of using /dev/rtc,
	because the latter only provides time with one second precision.

2004-04-11  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* Makefile.in (VERSION): version 1.18

	* Makefile.in (install): create manual directory if necessary

	* adjtimex.c (usage): Don't split strings across lines.
	(main): --reset switch enables resetting of status (no longer
	default action, because it's not needed by recent kernels) (thanks
	to Alain Guibert <alguibert at free.fr>)

2004-04-09  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* adjtimex.c (longopt): --status switch sets clock status
	(courtesy of Alain Guibert <alguibert at free.fr>
	
2004-04-04  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	for tick and freq.  (thanks to Sami Farin <safari at iki.fi>)
	(review): calculate reasonable tick and frequency when HZ != 100.
	(cmos_init): use /dev/rtc when available (thanks to Richard
	Henderson <rth at twiddle.net>

	* adjtimex.c (longopt): fix spelling to match documentation:

	letters again.

2003-05-31  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* adjtimex.c (usage): Escape the embedded newlines in the help
	message, and add explicit ones.  (gcc 3.3 complains otherwise)

2003-04-30  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* Makefile.in (VERSION): version 1.15

	* adjtimex.c: for ia64, call adjtimex instead of using syscall

2000-11-21  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* Makefile.in (VERSION): version 1.12

	* adjtimex.c (puthackent): clear lfile after closing file, so it
	does not get closed a second time (thanks to Bjorn Eriksson
	<mdeans at algonet.se>).

2000-05-14  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* Makefile.in (VERSION): version 1.11

	of an unsafe temporary file (thanks to Colin Phipps <crp22 at
	cam.ac.uk>) 

2000-01-03  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>

	* Makefile.in (VERSION): version 1.9

	Removed unused variables DISTFILES and MISC.

	* (VERSION): 1.8 (setting here rather than using RCS version
	number of adjtimex.c)

1998-11-28  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv at debian.org>
